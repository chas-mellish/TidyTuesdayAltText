The lower section of the image has four slope line plots showing home ownership percentages, average family wealth, family liquid retirement savings, and family student loan debt for Black, Hispanic, and white populations in 1989 and 2016.

Small multiples show the pattern for renewable energy, nuclear energy, and conventional thermal energy.
Germany is the largest energy producing country in Europe. It generates the most renewable and conventional thermal energy, representing 31% and 56% of its overall production respectively. France is the second largest energy European producer and by far the largest nuclear energy provider: 71% of its production is based on nuclear fission to generate heat.
Norway had an electricity production almost entirely made up of renewable energy (97.7%). This makes Norway the second largest producer of this energy type in Europe. Interestingly, most of the renewable energy is produced by hydro and pumped hydro power that take up 95% and only 2.6% by wind. In contrast, twelve European countries produce less than 20% of their energy with renewable resources."

The three seasons (called books) so far are named after the elements Water, Earth, and Fire so I asked myself: In each season, do characters mention the respective element more often?

The American animated television series ‚ÄúAvatar: The Last Airbender‚Äù is set in a world where human civilization consists of four nations, named after the four classical elements: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads. 
The three seasons (called books) so far are named after the elements Water, Earth, and Fire so I asked myself: In each season, do characters mention the respective element more often? Turns out: Fire is mentioned more often than the three other elements together in the third season‚Äîbut that does not apply to the other two seasons Water (book 1) and Earth (book 2)."
