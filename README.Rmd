# TidyTuesdayAltText

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `TidyTuesdayAltText` is to provide insight into the alternative (alt) text accompanying the data visualizations shared on Twitter as part of the TidyTuesday social project^[[rfordatascience/tidytuesday: Official repo for the #tidytuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r)].

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of TidyTuesdayAltText from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` r
install.packages("TidyTuesdayAltText")
```
-->
You can install the development version of `TidyTuesdayAltText` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spcanelon/TidyTuesdayAltText")
```
### Note about installing from a private repo

While this repo is private, you will first have to make sure to provide authentication to GitHub using a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) as a credential. You can follow the steps in the credential caching chapter of Happy Git with R (summarized below): [Chapter 10 Cache credentials for HTTPS | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)

1. Create a personal access token using a [`usethis` package helper function](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_github_token.html) which pre-selects recommended scopes/permissions: `usethis::create_github_token()`

1. Then store your token somewhere safe and treat it like you would a password.

1. Call an R function to store your credentials using the [`credentials` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/) which will prompt you to enter your token: `credentials::set_github_pat()`<br>
This populates the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable that `install_github()` defaults to as the authentication token (i.e. **auth_token**) argument.

1. Finally, proceed to install the package as usual: `devtools::install_github("spcanelon/TidyTuesdayAltText")`

## About the data

Original data were collected and made available by Tom Mock ([@thomas_mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) using [{rtweet}](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet).

Tweets were processed and scraped for alternative text by Silvia Canelón ([@spcanelon](https://twitter.com/spcanelon))
1. Data were filtered to remove tweets without attached media (e.g. images)
1. Data were supplemented with reply tweets collected using {rtweet}. This was done to identify whether the original tweet or a reply tweet contained an external link (e.g. data source, repository with source code)
1. Alternative (alt) text was scraped from tweet images using [{RSelenium}](https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/). The first image attached to each tweet was considered the primary image and only the primary image from each tweet was scraped for alternative text. The following attributes were used to build the scraper:
    - CSS selector: `.css-1dbjc4n.r-1p0dtai.r-1mlwlqe.r-1d2f490.r-11wrixw`
    - Element attribute: `aria-label` 
    
    ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.alt="Web inspection tool being used to identify the CSS selector corresponding to the primary image of one of Silvia's tweets with alt text", fig.cap="Web inspection used to identify a CSS selector utilized for alt-text web scraping"}
    knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/webInspection.png")
    ```

This data package does not include data that could directly identify the tweet author in order to respect any author's decision to delete a tweet or make their account private after the data was originally collected.^[https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy]

To obtain the tweet text, author screen name, and many other tweet attributes, you can "rehydrate" the `TweetId`s (or "status" ids^[[Tweet object | Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet)]) using the {rtweet} package.^[[Get tweets data for given statuses (status IDs). — lookup_tweets • rOpenSci: rtweet](https://docs.ropensci.org/rtweet/reference/lookup_tweets.html)]

### AltTextSubset

A dataset containing the alternative text for media shared between 2018 and 2021 as part of the TidyTuesday social project, and other attributes of 441 tweets. This is a subset of the 2018-2021 datasets, containing only tweets with alternative text that isn't "Image," the default alternative text added by the Twitter app in the absence of customized alternative text. More information can be found using `?AltTextSubset`.

- Dates included: April 10, 2018 to April 4, 2021.
- Observations (rows): There are 465 rows in this dataset. Each row represents a single unique tweet post.
- Variables (columns): There are 7 columns in this dataset. They are described below

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
createDataDictionary(AltTextSubset)

dataDictionary %>% knitr::kable(escape = TRUE)
```

## Example
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
```{r example}
library(TidyTuesdayAltText)
## basic example code
```
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
