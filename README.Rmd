# TidyTuesdayAltText

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `TidyTuesdayAltText` is to provide insight into the alternative (alt) text accompanying the data visualizations shared on Twitter as part of the TidyTuesday social project^[[rfordatascience/tidytuesday: Official repo for the #tidytuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#a-weekly-social-data-project-in-r)].

The package contains 5 datasets:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(TidyTuesdayAltText)
?ttTweets2018
?ttTweets2019
?ttTweets2020
?ttTweets2021
?AltTextSubset
```

## Installation
<!--
You can install the released version of TidyTuesdayAltText from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` r
install.packages("TidyTuesdayAltText")
```
-->
You can install the development version of `TidyTuesdayAltText` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("spcanelon/TidyTuesdayAltText")
```
### Note about installing from a private repo

While this repo is private, you will first have to make sure to provide authentication to GitHub using a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) as a credential. You can follow the steps in the credential caching chapter of Happy Git with R (summarized below): [Chapter 10 Cache credentials for HTTPS | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html)

1. Create a personal access token using a [`usethis` package helper function](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_github_token.html) which pre-selects recommended scopes/permissions: `usethis::create_github_token()`

1. Then store your token somewhere safe and treat it like you would a password.

1. Call an R function to store your credentials using the [`credentials` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/credentials/) which will prompt you to enter your token: `credentials::set_github_pat()`<br>
This populates the `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable that `install_github()` defaults to as the authentication token (i.e. **auth_token**) argument.

1. Finally, proceed to install the package as usual: `devtools::install_github("spcanelon/TidyTuesdayAltText")`

## Data details

### AltTextSubset

A dataset containing the alternative text for media shared between 2018 and 2021 as part of the TidyTuesday social project, and other attributes of 441 tweets. This is a subset of the 2018-2021 datasets, containing only tweets with alternative text that isn't "Image," the default alternative text added by the Twitter app in the absence of customized alternative text.

- Dates included: April 10, 2018 to April 4, 2021.
- Observations (rows): There are 465 rows in this dataset. Each row represents a single unique tweet post.
- Variables (columns): There are 7 columns in this dataset. They are described below

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
createDataDictionary(AltTextSubset)

dataDictionary %>% knitr::kable(escape = TRUE)
```

### ttTweets2021

- Dates included: January 1, 2021 to April 4, 2021.
- Observations (rows): There are 1032 rows in this dataset. Each row represents a single unique tweet post.
- Variables (columns): There are 7 columns in this dataset. They are described below

```{r echo=FALSE}
createDataDictionary(ttTweets2021)

dataDictionary %>% knitr::kable()
```

### ttTweets2020

- Variables (columns): There are 7 columns in this dataset. They are described below

```{r echo=FALSE}
createDataDictionary(ttTweets2020)

dataDictionary %>% knitr::kable()
```

### ttTweets2019

Link to the raw data: [data-raw/ttTweets2019.csv](data-raw/ttTweets2019.csv)

- Dates included: January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019.
- Observations (rows): There are 2022 rows in this dataset. Each row represents a single unique tweet post.
- Variables (columns): There are 7 columns in this dataset. They are described below

```{r echo=FALSE}
createDataDictionary(ttTweets2019)

dataDictionary %>% knitr::kable()
```

### ttTweets2018

Link to the raw data: [data-raw/ttTweets2018.csv](data-raw/ttTweets2018.csv)

- Dates included: April 2, 2018 to December 31, 2018.
- Observations (rows): There are 709 rows in this dataset. Each row represents a single unique tweet post.

createDataDictionary(ttTweets2018)

dataDictionary %>% knitr::kable()
```

<!--
## Example
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
```{r example}
library(TidyTuesdayAltText)
## basic example code
```
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
